Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.
Take it one section at a time.
The website you're creating has 4 main sections and a footer.
So pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on.
Starting at the top is always a solid plan.
For the section you're working on, do the HTML first and then do the CSS.
Using only one CSS file is adequate for this project.
Many of the elements are very smilar to thing you saw in Flexbox exercises.
Feel free to go back to those if you need a refresher.
Do not worry about making your project look nice on a mobile device.
When you finish, don't forget to push it up to GitHub.
